Does the water flow routing according the D8 algorithm.

kwargs:
- drain_pits -- whether to route through pits (true)
- maxiter -- maximum iterations of the algorithm (max(size(dem)...)*2)
- calc_streamlength -- whether to calculate stream length (true).
                       Not calculating stream-length can speed up calculations considerably.
- bnd_as_pits (true) -- whether the domain boundary and NaNs should be pits,
                 i.e. adjacent cells can drain into them,
                 or whether to ignore them.

TODO: if bnd_as_pits routes water along boundary edges first. This would probably
substantially reduce the number of catchments, as currently every boundary point
is a pit and thus a catchment (if bnd_as_pits==true).

Returns
- area -- upslope area
- stream-length -- length of stream to the farthest source
- dir -- flow direction at each location
- nout -- whether the point has outlflow.  I.e. nout[I]==0 --> I is a pit
- nin -- number of inflow cells
- pits -- location of pits as Vector{CartesianIndex{2}}
- c -- catchment map
- bnds -- boundaries between catchments.  The boundary to the exterior/NaNs is not in here.

Return an updated direction field which drains (interior) pits.

There needs to be a decision on how to treat the outer boundary and boundaries
to NaN-cells.  Possibilities:
- do not treat boundary cells as pits but do treat pits at the boundary as terminal.
- treat boundary cells as pits, i.e. flow reaching such a cell will vanish.  Again
  such cells would be terminal.  This is currently done

What to do if there are no terminal pits in the DEM?  Fill to the uppermost pit?  Or take
the lowermost as terminal?

    fill_dem(dem, pits, dir)

Fill the pits (aka sinks) of a DEM (apply this after applying "drainpits",
which is the default). Returns the filled DEM.

Note, this is not needed as pre-processing step to use `upstream` area.

This uses a tree traversal to fill the DEM. It does it depth-first (as it
is easier) which may lead to a stack overflow on a large DEM.
