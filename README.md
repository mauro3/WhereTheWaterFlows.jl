This package allows to calculate water flow paths on digital elevation models (DEMs).

This package implements the D8 flow routing algorithm [1] as well as a
basin-filling algorithm, also by [1].  In its implementation it uses a
O(n), recursive algorithm similar as in [2].  Due to recursion it can run
into a stackoverflow error on very large DEMs.

This code is reasonably fast: flow routing on a DEM of Antarctica of
about 2e8 points (14000x14000) with 150000 depressions takes about 30s
on my laptop (Ryzen 4750U).

Example of upslope area calculated in below example.

## Manual

The main function of this package is `waterflows`, please refer to its
doc-string.  Here a simple example using it:

```julia
using WhereTheWaterFlows, GLMakie
const WWF = WhereTheWaterFlows

"Synthtic DEM with a few maxs and mins"
function peaks2(n=100, randfac=0.05)
    coords = range(-pi, pi, length=n)
    return coords, coords, sin.(coords) .* cos.(coords') .-
        0.7*(sin.(coords.+1) .* cos.(coords')).^8 .+
        randfac*randn(n,n)
end
x,y,dem = peaks2(200)
area, slen, dir, nout, nin, sinks, pits, c, bnds = waterflows(dem)

# log-upslope area as well as pits (sinks)
plt_area(x, y, area, pits)

# catchments
plt_catchments(x,y,c)

# A single catchment of some point.  Choose one with large catchment:
i, j = 50, findmax(area[50,:])[2]
cc = catchment(dir, CartesianIndex(i,j))
heatmap(x,y,cc)
scatter!(x[i], y[j], markersize=50)

# stream length
heatmap(x,y,slen)

demf = fill_dem(dem, sinks, dir)
# "lake-depth"
heatmap(x, y, demf.-dem)
```

In the `example/` folder there are two more complicated examples.  One
showcases the ability to route several quantities at once with
self-feedback via the `feedback_fn`.

### Post-processing

There are the following function (see their docs for details):
- `catchment` -- determine the catchment of a point or a set of points
- `catchments` -- determine the catchment of several sink areas (each
  defined by a set of points)
- `catchment_flux` -- the total flux or source area in a particular catchment
- `prune_catchments` -- remove catchments smaller than a certain size
- `fill_dem` -- fill the depressions of a DEM
